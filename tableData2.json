I travelled 35 miles specifically to buy one as I leave work this week and wanted to thank my staff. Due to work commitments The Trafford Centre is ideal due to its late opening times of 10pm. \r\n\r\nAt approximately 7:50 I went to the Millie's stall that was advertising how the cookies are \"made in 40 minutes\", when asked if I could order one he said I was best going to the shop closer to John Lewis and ordering there as that's where they are made. At about 8:05 I got to the shop and was told that they had \"run out\" but the shop near the food hall should have some left so I should go there. As this was in the complete other direction the stall had sent me, I was quite irritated, but had no other option. At about 8:15 I got to the food court Millie's, to be told they \"stopped serving at 8\" for the giant cookies - something the shop upstairs didn't oblige to, something they didn't warn me of and something that was not advertised anywhere. And again, the cookies were being displayed in the window as an item that could be purchased. The staff were in no way helpful and told me if I were to order now they would have to cook it fresh - this problem baffled me with an hour and 45mins until closing. \r\n\r\nI feel extremely let down by all three stores and the customer service. I went out of my way to purchase one of your products as I think so highly of them and was left more than disappointed. As someone who has worked in retail myself, I can appreciate how important customer service is and I don't feel any of your members of staff or services were at their best.",

As I reached the counter I noticed a box of lettuce and was told it had just arrived.  I decided to stay.  At approx 1 35 my wine arrived.  By now the restaurant was busy.  People arriving later than me had their food orders delivered.  I asked a waitress where my order was.  She claimed she plated it at around 1 15 and would check.   Within 10 mins a salad arrived (no bacon) I sent it back!  5 mins later it arrived and I have to say was perfectly acceptable.  By now more staff had arrived.  \r\n\r\nWhen I arrived at the restaurant there were around 12 people, it later filled and most were served their food before me.  When I left we were down to about 12 again.  \r\n\r\nI am really sorry that the service in this restaurant has led me to complain as I was pleased to find a quiet restaurant with a good menu.  I probably won t return and I guess it's back to Dexters from now on.\r\n\r\nYours sincerely\r\n\r\nJill Aburrow",

In any case, with my very poor Spanish I said we want to eat. He said no. You cant eat. I sais I'd like to sit down and eat. he said No, I couldn't. Finally I took a menu and sat then order some nachos and a quesadilla plate. Guess what, they could serve us that bar snacks food. However, the chips were stale, and the lettuce under the quesadilla was dirty (sandy) and old. So, we didn't even touch it. It tasted disgusting. So nobody came over to check on us while we poked at the food, and I again I had to interrupt the music loving customer-ignoring couple to get the bill. The staff didn't care.

The writing is crap, sloppy, slanted, uneven and just looks apauling not to mention the splodges of icing dotted around. In the photos we had tried to get as much off as possible but we couldn't get any more off and that's what we were left with, I know it was only £15 but it's the fact that it very annoying and frustrating and the customer service that I received was terrible. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you are able to do, I would really appreciate it as I'm defiantly not a happy customer... \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nMollie Young",

Now I find this very hard to believe that you have ran out of baguettes, given that sometimes I have gone there at 12. I actually think it is done deliberately to be an inconvenience to customers and try to provide as little option as possible as it just is not good enough as I bet if I were to turn up tomorrow when the offer is not valid, there would be a lot more too offer, or even perhaps at 4 this afternoon when the offer is no longer valid.\r\n\r\nI just don't think it's acceptable really and think this needs to be changed. You can't offer a poor service just because there is an offer on that you have agreed to run and I suggest you raise this with the Fenchurch Street branch.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nSiobhan",

The lady that’s served me, has responded rudely without looking at me, that she will accept only a code for 1 phone. I’ve responded by saying that last time one of her colleague's has served me by accepting the codes from two different phone contracts. \r\nThis person has reply back again without looking at me, that she will serve only for a code and if I’m not happy, I don’t need to come to Upper Crust. At this point, because her attitude was unacceptable and I’ve decided to speak to the Manager of this branch, during the time that I can be served by her colleague that was embarrassed with this situation. \r\nAfter having been served, by her colleague, I had told to the arrogant lady that was trying to contact her manager that her attitude was disgraced and it is unacceptable to talk to the customer like that. Because of this situation I’ve left and I went to another store of the station to get another sandwich. Few minutes later this arrogant lady, came and chased me because I’ve not paid the sandwich. \r\nEffectively, with this situation was so intense that I’ve completely forgotten to pay the sandwich. So I went back with this arrogant lady to pay for my sandwich and I’ve asked her to give me her name in order for me to place a complaint. She replied, \"No, why I should give you my name\". So I’ve decided to take a picture and from there she told me to \"**** OFF\", in front of the other clients. \r\nThis is very embarrassing, I’m so gutted by the way this lady has spoken to me. First of all, she said that if I’m not happy I don't have to come at Upper crust and secondly she told me, to **** off!!!! Where are we going, all of that just for a sandwich!!!! This is unacceptable and I would like that your services take actions on this lady behaviour. This is not acceptable, during my lunch break someone treat me like that, and I’m a customer and was a regular customer of Upper crust. I'm deeply disappointed. This happened on June 20th, 2016\r\n\r\nTo resolve this issue I would like you to I would like, that actions be taken regarding this lady's behaviour, I'm expecting apologise from this lady and also compensation caused by this trouble because she has ruined my lunch break and I did not enjoyed the sandwich that I’ve bought.\r\n\r\nPlease reply to my resolver email account as I would like to keep all of my communications in my personalised complaints case file.\r\n\r\nYours faithfully\r\n\r\nMathieu Legrand",

This was obviously a mistake, which I should have remarked, but did not at the time.\r\n \r\nI have got the receipt, but not the specification of my purchase.

Having looked online the easiest way to get this was to go to my nearest store. I Called the Watford store a number of times, no answer so i left a message expecting a call back so my order could be taken or if not advice given. Having heard nothing and saw on the website they opened at 11am on Sunday 24th I thought I Had better go as otherwise I would have a step daughter with no birthday cake/cookie. Went and store not open. No sign displayed or anything. I thought I would give the benefit of the doubt and maybe a slightly delayed opening due to a Sunday. So i returned some time later and still not open. I asked a member of the security team from Intu and he simply replied \"Am not sure think they have staffing problems\". Not happy at all at my wasted journey, money on fuel and parking but more importantly no cookie for my step daughter I returned home. On route I called the Brent Cross store as a last resort, this was around 1240 hrs. Again no answer so I left a message. Time went I by so I called again and still no answer. Answer machine messages for both stores say they will return your call ASAP. That is not true as far as I have experienced.\r\nPlease register this as a complaint and I look forward to hearing your response.\r\nLouise McIVER.",

I ordered a turkey apple Brie sandwich which they forgot to put apple on.  My husband had a 1/2 grilled cheese.  These girls acted like they were a) completely put out that they were there and b) even more put out when we changed our mind at the register about an candy bar we decided not to get.  Before my credit card was even swiped, they had to call the manager to change the order.  After waiting for him for about 10 minutes, we asked if they could just move our stuff to the other register and ring it up so we could go on to catch our flight.  The African American girl said nothing and didn't even acknowledge my question until I asked her if she heard me. She said she couldn't...which made no sense at all.  They had no problem or concern with making us wait.   Finally the African American manager showed up and he had no personality or customer service attitude either and didn't even apologize for making us wait.  Truly a terrible experience in Houston.

          "value": "Truly the worst service I have ever experienced. Literally so bad it was comical. I went from being irritated, to angry to highly amused at just how bad the girl working behind the counter was. I mean, she was trying, it wasn't like she had a bad attitude but just 100% incompetent. So I sit down at the bar, look at the menu and order a breakfast sandwich, orange juice and an English breakfast tea. The tea really threw her for a loop! We had a good 2 minute conversation about what tea was right there and she seemed to start to grasp the concept. She was very unsure about the English breakfast part though and after spending a minute or 2 looking through the tea bag selection brought the whole tray over for me to chose. I picked out an English breakfast tea out of the section of English breakfast tea bags that very clearly had English breakfast tea written on the label. By this point I could see she was struggling but thought the worst was behind us. How wrong I was. So she puts the bag aside, puts my receipt/check in a glass in front of me then gets distracted and goes to another customer who has just arrived and sat a couple of stools down. I glance at my check and see the sandwich, the tea, a coffee but no juice on there. No big deal right? Probably the same price so whatever, yeah...not so much. I sit there and wait for maybe 5 minutes. The guy who came in after me gets his juice and water. The guy who came in after him gets his too. So I ask her if I can get mine. It clicks on her face that she forgot and she says sure and grabs a glass. Then something else clicks in her head and she ask if she charged me for it. I tell her that she charged for coffee and tea but no juice. So she puts the glass down, takes the check away, goes to the cash register and taps away for 30 seconds and comes back with a new check for the glass in front of me. She added the juice but the coffee is still on there also. Then she gets distracted again and goes off to give someone their food. I should also mention at this point that over the course of the hour I was there, at no point did she have any clue who ordered what. When an order came out she started at one end of the bar and asked every person if it was their order until someone claimed it. Anyhow, I digress. Still juiceless, I call her over and point out that while she managed to add the juice to the check there was a coffee on there that I did not order. Really, she asks. You sure you do not want coffee? I assure that I have no desire at all for coffee, but juice would be fantastic. Instead of getting juice she feels the need to confirm that I do still want the tea. She must have felt that in the now 10-15 minutes since I ordered and we had the conversation on what tea was the I may now no longer want it. I tell her that I still want the tea, and the juice, and the sandwich just no coffee. Back she heads to the register to try and take the coffee off. Still juiceless. After 1-2 minutes of trying to remove the coffee she gives up and makes a phone call and presumably someone who is not a complete idiot tells her how to do it. She finally returns the correct check to glass but still no juice or tea. However at this point my food has arrived on the food window at she starts the mystery trip down the bar to see who's food it might be. When she realizes it's mine she asks if I mind that it's boxed to go. I tell her that it is the least of my worries right now and that it's fine. However, I continue, I am quite parched and I would really really like my juice to go with the food if she could possibly manage it. Also, at some point in the near future the tea would be amazing. I'd say this was the point I went from irritated to pretty pissed off. Miracles happen and I get my juice and an apology. I drink my drink, eat my food and wait. I'd say by this point I'd probably been there 40 minutes. Finally back she comes to take care of the tea. It is now very apparent that she understood none of the previous tea conversation. She has the bag still in packet in her hand and inquires how to make said tea. I explain again that a cup with water is needed, then add bag inside packet to water. After this is done, add a little milk and that is it. Tea. How much water, she asks? Like, half a cup? I tell her to imagine a cup of coffee, how full do you think you would fill that? I also make sure that she understands that I am just saying this so she has a visual reference and that I do not actually want coffee. She assures me she has got it and promptly returns with a cold mug of water. I believe this is the point where anger subsides and I start giggling. I tell her that hot water, boiling even is needed and that cold water will not work. I don't think she believed me at first from the expression on her face but she didn't question it. Finally I had my tea. An hour or so after I came in and I'm ready to pay, as are the 2 people either side of me. All 3 of us checks and credit cards in hand but she is totally oblivious. Eventually I get her attention and tell her I would like to pay so I can leave and catch my flight. Despite there being a card reader on the counter behind her she directs me to the register, which she is also the sole operator of. I don't argue, pick up my bags and go to the back of the fairly long line waiting for their adventure with the most incompetent human being I have ever come across. So that was my morning.",

I fortunately got a relative to go during the day today and buy the cookie and drop it off at the school where I work! Unfortunately she had to buy the cookie as it was a present and there was no other time for me to give this present! The cookie is no where near the standard of various other giant cookies that I have bought in the past (photo evidence to prove)! The cookie I received today was rushed, no care taken and the icing was appalling around the edges and the writing touched the edge! The icing around the edge varies in size and is small and the writing is poor and unprofessional! When you pay £15 you want to receive the highest quality item! Also my relative said that there was bad customer service and that the woman was stern with her. Please can you resolve this problem asap.

I always buy and receive these for birthdays and they are always lovely but my husband has just gave me one for my birthday and there is hardly any icing inbetween the cookies. As you can see from the uploaded picture, there is just a wiggle of piped icing which means when cut, most of the cookie isn't held together and has no filling at all. He also asked for smarties on (mainly for my little girl) and these haven't been put on either. It was collected Friday 1st and I had to throw away 1/4 on Monday due to being too dry to eat, it's as if this cookie was not made fresh, and has been quickly thrown together. This was ordered 5 days before needed, from the arcade Meadowhall store. \r\nI am very disappointed this time and hope this isn't something that continues to happen in the future, as I am a regular customer.

Luckily the people who got given them said they weren't for them and gave them to us after we made ourselves known. No apology from staff member. When they arrived there was 2 tiny spoonful's of pulled pork on it, at most. Considering the price difference from the regular natchos we expected more for our money. The pulled pork was cold. We mentioned it to a member of staff (after managing to get someone's attention) who then put the whole dish in the microwave. Again, no apology. The natchos came back hard and the pulled pork only luke warm. The natchos under the top layer we all crumbs. We had to use a spoon to be able to eat these. The worst bit was that the melted cheese had mold on!!!! It completely put us off eating it.\r\nOverall found the experience incredibly disappointing and extremely overpriced for what we got, even for airport food. Staff very disinterested and one we tried to complain to barely spoke English so didn't understand us. We gave up! Won't be coming again.",

At the time I didn't feel comfortable saying anything but a lot of people mentioned it at the party, which obviously was rather embarrassing. It became a bit of a joke, which is not the reason I bought it! I feel that £20 for a large cookie is rather expensive, and the fact the writing was so wonky really doesn't seem good value to money to me. I'd be interested to hear your thoughts. \r\n\r\nI have attached a photo of the cookie. \r\n\r\nKind regards\r\n\r\nJessica bodle \r\n\r\nSent from my iPhone",

I felt something may be wrong as was taking a while for response. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBasically I went along to the Livingston branch on Thursday 16th June early morning after dropping my daughter at school. I stay in Newmains, Wishaw, so I am not near a store and both Glasgow Fort and Livingston are equal distances to our home. I chose Livingston as I know the road better and find it easier than motorway.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAnyway when I arrived I went to counter and advised that I had came to order the giant double cookie for my husband’s 30th birthday which was the following day. I was asked when I wanted the cookie, I stated asap, and that I would be in Livingston for couple of hours. The assistant (Lynzi) looked atme blankly and advised ‘it wont be today im on myself and have other orders’ \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI was disappointed and went on to advise the reason I had drove the journey was because I had checked website prior, which stated they can be made while you wait etc, collect within certain time frame. Anyway she was unsympathetic and still advised NO, that she had orders to be done for fathering Sunday (this was thurdsay at 9am) she didn’t look too busy to be fair when we arrived. I explained the situation however she was having none of it and quite bluntly told me she wasn’t making the cookie, then asked when I needed it for , don’t understand why she changed so quickly. I said I was in Livingston for couple of hours getting few things for my husbands birthday, however I would then need to leave to collect daughter from school for 3pm.  She then changed her mind and stated she could do it, but it would be after 4pm. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAt this point i was feeling disappointed and frustrated so just left and advised it was ok, she was clearly being difficult for whatever reason...\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAnyway I walked to another store to find my mum who was with me.. explained to her the situation, which she was also upset and wanted to go down to store and ask the girl herself however I asked her not to. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI then panicked as wondered what I would do in place of the cookie with my husbands birthday being the next day and knowing how much he loves millies cookies... I decided to call Glasgow Fort store. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI explained the whole situation and the lady was so helpful. She couldn’t understand what had just happened and agreed it was unacceptable. She advised she could make the giant cookie right now for me to collect. Nothing was too much trouble for her, I dreaded the long journey however knew that I would need to go collect it ... so I placed order and made payment by card over phone and agreed to pick it up in 1 hour 30 mins. (time chosen by me to ensure I would be there in time with traffic etc. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI was still feeling angry and upset, my mum could see this too , as we walked past the millies store again to head back to carpark – Lynzi still didn’t look busy – my mum leaned in to tell her we had placed the order at the Glasgow Fort and that we were on way to get it... Lynzi then completely changed mind and said she could make it for 2pm... we advised no good, she then advised she could make it for 12pm, then finally says she will make it right now for us...... and to come back in an hour. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis was so frustrating..as i explained i had just made payment for it over the phone... Lynzi stood while i contacted the Fort store who sadly advised I would need to visit the store anyway even if it was for a refund as they did not have the facility to refund over telephone. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBy this point I was exhausted by whole situation and so was my mum who was unwell as doesn’t keep very well.... we just left and went along to the fort however really did feel the must to let Millies know about this and hopefully help restore our faith in Millies, as right now I feel I will never return which is sad as we go as a family often\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI sent the email weeks ago using the form on the website however now discovered its not been received – hoping someone can assist me with this...",

The website does not provide a telephone number and an emailed complaint has not received any response. Following some research online I found a telephone number and confirmed with the receptionist that it belonged to Millie's Cookies Online. However, upon being transferred to the Customer Service team OR the Sales Team, the telephone number either rings out indefinitely or goes straight to a voicemail message advising me that the office is closed. I am surprised that the office was closed at 4pm on Wednesday, and at 9.20am on Thursday. Surely normal working days/hours? I feel very disappointed with the product, but even more disappointed that my issue cannot be resolved due to the unavailability of...well...anyone. Very frustrating. If you would like a photo of the product I can provide it. At this point I would like a full refund. Incidentally, and as constructive feedback, I regularly order similar food items online and have never received anything so badly packaged. The damage is hardly surprising.",

This is the first time I have this store as I usually use the Cafe Nero upstairs (terminal 3 arrivals area). I was given a card asking me to rate my experience and that I was served by 'Jess' (see attached). At this point she informed me my panini would be a couple of minutes. All fine so far. When she handed over my panini, she did so with her back to me while she was chatting to her co-worker behind the counter, which i found slightly amusing given that she had just given me a card with her name on it asking me to rate her performance. But there you have it. With this knowledge I decided that i would give you some feedback and this is that part of my story.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, things got much worse. I commented to my colleagues that the panini and the coffee cost me £7.50 (approx), which is very expensive for lunch but almost understandable as it's in an airport. This, therefore, wouldn't have been an issue if either of the items were of good quality. Let's start with the coffee. Like I said earlier, I generally go to Cafe Nero and it's fair to say i will return there next time instead of your establishment. The coffee at Cafe Nero is unsurprisingly better and for that I'm not really bothered, but the coffee served to me by your staff was way, way too hot. So hot in fact that I burnt my tongue. I actually just so happen to know a lot about how to make coffee and I can tell you the milk was badly prepared and burnt as to make the coffee taste pretty horrible. I don't expect you to have great coffee, but please train your staff on how to not burn the milk. \r\n\r\nAnd finally, the ultimate nail in the coffin... The panini was, excuse my French, 'La merde'. There was hardly any bacon in it and the brie had melted all over the paper I was given. hardly any of it stayed in the wrapper. In hindsight, I would have taken a picture but I hadn't envisaged sending an email telling you about my disappointment at that time.\r\n\r\nThe big issue i have is that i assume your sandwichs are all the same and delivered in the mornings. If so, that indicates to me that they're all terrible. It doesn;t make me want to go back, ever. You're really going to struggle to compete with Cafe Nero upstairs (or many other shops in many other places) if this is the standard that you're giving. \r\n\r\nI feel a little robbed by the whole situation to be honest. The quality all round was just so poor. I'd be interested to hear what you have to say on the matter.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nSimon",

I thought the portion was on the small side also, considering the pricing. They have a table number system which means that you order at the bar and they deliver the food. All good you say, just wait until you want to have something else spontaneously, like a tea or coffee or dessert. You guessed it, leave all your bags at the table and go back up to the bar, queue again and place your order. The waiting staff are pleasant enough, but are let down by the system. I ordered an apple pie for dessert and yes, nuked again with the pastry casing morphing and doughy, it was so hot.

Secondly the customer service was poor and at no point did any of our servers smile or check if our food was ok and thirdly my mother in law and friend also ordered food with us and both of their sausage and mash meals came without watercress. Upon asking where this was no apology was made and after a very long time a small bowl was provided. \r\n\r\nI would appreciate a response as we left feeling hungry and disappointed - not a great start to our holiday.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nJemma",

Jeg checkede ikke umiddelbart min bon - men det burde jeg have gjort - for da jeg forlod jeres restaurant, blev jeg opmærksom på en vinduesreklame for netop Monarchs bearnaise burger. Det måltid jeg fik serveret lignede ikke ret godt det måltid, der var afbilledet i reklamen. Bl.a. var de rustikke pommes frites på ingen måde vellignende mht. udseende eller servering. I reklamen var afbilledet en dip serveret i et mindre glas, hvilket jeg opfatter som væsentligt forskelligt fra den mayo dip af mrk. Heinz, jeg fik serveret i engangsplast-emballage. Da jeg efterfølgende checkede min bon, kunne jeg konstatere, at jeg havde betalt kr. 5,- for dip samt kr. 6,- for en grovbolle. Bollen var ca. det eneste der lignede noget i reklamen. Jeg er herefter af den opfattelse, at jeg har betalt for dip, der jf. reklamen måtte opfattes som en del af måltidet, ligesom jeg har betalt for en grovbolle, jeg ligeledes opfatter som værende en del af i måltidet. Jeg blev ikke af ekspedienten gjort bekendt med at mit valg af bolle eller dip betød en merpris. Altså burde jeg kun have betalt kr. 119,- for burger måltidet og ikke ekstra i alt kr. 11,- for dip og grovbolle. Min kæreste og jeg køre ofte i bil fra København til Nordjylland, og vi spiser fra tid til anden på Monarch. Det skal derfor ikke forstås negativt, når jeg skriver, at jeg ikke forventer \"restaurations\"-måltider på Monarch. Jeg synes imidlertid ikke, at omhandlende måltid var, hvad jeg burde kunne forvente. Jeg fandt anledning til at tage fotos af burgeren, og jeg har efterfølgende taget et foto af reklamen for samme burger. For mig er der stor forskel på, hvad jeg forventer og det jeg rent faktisk får.\r\nMed venlig hilsen\r\nHenrik Jensen",

I tried To take a sip but the coffee was so bad and the test was awful and I was very tempted to go back and ask for my money back but did not at end. instead I decided to complain to you. You need to use different kind of coffee beans. It was the first time I can recall where I could not take more then one small sip. Likely it was still hot and that is why I limited my self to a very small sip. I have no doubt that if I had taken a large sip I would have forced to spit out.

It's the first time I have used the discount at the stand (as I usually forget), but I do often get my lunch from that point at the station. \r\n\r\nThe lady taking the order was very abrubt, but I expected this as there was a queue. Then when I picked up a bottle of drink from the fridge I was told that I could't have that one I could only have a 'warm' (she actually said warm!) bottle of coca cola from the counter. I asked why and she said that the cold bottles were for 'regular customers'. Rather than hold up the queue I took the bottle and went to pick up some pop corn and was told I could only have a ready salted bag of crisps. I'm not sure if that's a requirement of the deal?\r\n\r\nAnyway, I just didn't appreciate that I was made to feel like I was a second-rate customer just because I was using your O2 deal, especially considering that I often get lunch there at full price! \r\n\r\nThank you for your time, \r\n\r\nCath\r\n\r\n(sorry, I don't think I was offered a receipt!)",

Only returning home I found that the apple on the cookie was missing a stalk and leaf and looked more like a tomato and the writing on the cookie wasn't correct she had written the majority of the letters in capitals and the remaining two letter in lower case which looked awful and certainly not grammatically correct to give a teacher! I drove 20 minutes to get back to the shop and explain that I wanted it changed. They then wiped the two lower case letters of the end and replaced them with capitals and told me they realised they couldn't do a leaf this morning as they had run out of green! I asked well couldn't you do something else and her response was a shoulder shrug! I am disappointed with the cookie and also they customer service. I left me order until the last day of term so that it would be fresh for the Teacher but I now wish I hadn't bothered the cookie doesn't resemble the Internet advertisement at all.",

The sausage roll was poor - I had waited 15 mins for an unbuttered, untoasted sandwich. It was tiny, especially compared to the bacon roll my husband had. 1.5 tiny sausages. I mentioned it to the manager who was very attentive to my complaint but his 'hands were tied' to do anything. He kindly offered to reimbourse me but at that point I had waited 15 mins and needed something before I jumped on my flight. \r\n\r\nRegards\r\nHilary Cullen",

I had to then board my train, which I did, sat down and proceeded to eat the food. The \"large chips\" had approximately 15 chips in the bag which had been dumped in the bottom of the bag and had spilled over. The steak house burger was really really cool, not cold but no where near 63c which is the legal minimum for hot food service in the UK. I was expecting a little heat loss of course, but this was seriously cool, and clearly had not been heated properly prior to service. Whether that was something to do with the long wait for service I have no idea. Overall grumpy staff slow service under heated food, miserly chip portions, would have gone back immediately if I had not had to get a train, very disappointed. I wont be visiting SSP station outlets after this, a burger to make and serve is hardly rocket science, and a smile when serving costs nothing.",

The sign that the waiter told us to look at for information was a small grey sign on top of a beer menu; everyone at the table is under the age of 21. Finally after downloading the outrageous app simply to split our check, it takes the waiter at least 45 more minutes to \"print the check.\" This is a service to us the consumers.

So many restaurant chains manage to make allergy information clear on their websites I'm surprised you haven't. I saw that the bacon baguette doesn't have milk in but double checked when I was being served. I was told it isn't dairy free after all. I then asked if there was anything dairy free to which I was told there was not. Either you don't have any dairy free produce, which I find hard to believe, your staff are inadequately trained as to the contents of your produce or the allergy information I found is out of date (see previous comment regarding information on your website!)

I got off the train at Euston around 11:40 and visited your Euston branch for some lunch, approximately 11:45. When paying for my order I used contactless payment with my card and the card machine beeped as it took my payment. The cashier then advised that the till had crashed and my payment and transaction didn't go through. I advised the cashier that the card machine had beeped and I was sure it had taken payment.  But the cashier assured me it hadn't worked as the till has froze and it was still waiting for payment. The cashier then advised I would need to pay by cash as all the tills had froze.  I didn't have cash on me and I had an appointment starting at 12:00 just off Oxford street, so needed to leave straight away to catch the tube. I advised the cashier and left my lunch as I had no cash. I have checked my mobile banking this morning and noticed that payment has been taken.  As you can imagine I'm not best pleased. Not only was I left hungry before my meeting. But I have now been charged for the privilege. Can you please reimberse me for the transaction. I know this was a technical issue with you till systems, and not the fault of the cashier, but as high can imagine it's not the best customer service I have ever received. Attached is a screenshot of my mobile banking, which displays the tranacstion number, I assume you can find all the relevant information from this. If you need anymore information, please don't hesitate to get in touch with me on the following email: royliam@hotmail.com.\r\nLook forward to hearing from him soon.\r\nMany thanks,\r\nLiam.",

I could have sat in the restaurant and eaten more quickly. Others were notably perturbed at how long food was taking. I finally got my burger, walked back to the gate and... there was cheese on my burger! I had to throw it out and walked on to a plane with no food.  It was 8 hours until I had a proper meal.  As a former short-order cook I know two things: 1) It should not take 20 minutes to cook a mushroom and throw it on a bun, especially when there were only two orders in front of it. 2) when someone asks for no cheese, and it is in all caps on an order slip of one item, and there are only two other orders on your line, there should be no error.",

It was not possible to differentiate between the latta and cappuccino, they were exactly the same drink. Fail\r\n\r\nThe two male members of staff appeared disinterested in serving and obviously didn't appear to care. Fail.\r\n\r\nWhat an appauling way to run a facility.

Most mayonnaise is acceptable as it is not home made and is made with powdered eggs but I have to check. The server was very unhelpful and did not know. This is quite basic information that staff should know. There were large signs saying if you have food allergies / dietary requirements speak to the server who can advise you.

Gone is the shredded potato and swede with chunks of beef in a tasty gravy to be replaced by a \"semi-mash\" and very small pieces of meat bordering on mince.  The famous crust has got progressively \"soggier\" too.  It is now at a point where the \"value\" is less than the \"price\" and I will no longer be buying, which is a shame, as previously your \"Large Traditionals\" were a staple fare for the 45 min train ride home from KGX to BIW.  I remember when your stall first opened at the end of platform 8. Sad to see where it has come.  I'm not \"complaining\" and I'm not asking for my money back, I just think you ought to know that your \"offering\" has declined. Yes, you may have a broader range of products and the shiny new outlet in the new concourse is great, but if the food is poor, then your trade will decline.  Sort it out please.

At your Dublin Airport Departure Lounge branch on 25th June last I purchased 4 items at a cost of€16.28. I submitted €50 and expected €33.72 in change. I am not sure if you are aware of the system in that particular outlet, but one moves to the side to collect the beverages. My attendant was brusque, telling customers to form just one line, and then bustled them away. I was left short €3 which I noticed by accident. This happened all too easily and I was given the €3 but I was angry and said to the staff member that this was a very bad mistake to make. I have been thinking about this. I fit a certain profile. I was travelling out. How many of us are shortchanged here without noticing it? I would suggest a large notice on the counter beside the Till requesting that customers check their change before leaving the counter. I would also have a word with staff to make sure that the correct change is given, it wou ld not do for the public to think that a scam is taking place. And I would have a word with your staff at the Dublin Airport Terminal One Departure lounge to make sure that they give accurate change to every customer, especially in the knowledge that they most likely will never meet them again. I am keeping the receipt in case you want it. Yours sincerely, Caitriona Lawlor",

We stayed in villas 765 and 770 over the last weekend.\r\n\r\nFirstly my reservation for Sunday lunch had been booked on the Saturday, I got this changed successfully when we arrived.\r\n\r\nWe asked for our kids main meals to arrive when the adults main meals arrived, they all came at the same time as the adults starters.\r\n\r\nWe then had to wait an hour for our main courses to arrive and it wasn't that busy.\r\n\r\nOne of our party asked for some sauce to go with his meal and he was told by the lady delivering the meals quite rudely \"let me deliver these meals first and then I'll get some!\"\r\n\r\nMy mums roast beef dinner was awful and was knocked off the bill no questions asked - the roast potatoes were still frozen in the middle, carrots rock hard and beef very chewy. She couldn't eat any of it. Most of the other meals were luke warm. \r\n\r\nIt was supposed to be a birthday celebration meal for my dad and all in all it was very poor food and service.\r\n\r\nOther than my mums frozen dinner we didn't make a scene as the lady taking our order did her best but behind the scenes cooking and service needs to improve.\r\n\r\nRather than putting this feedback on trip adviser I thought I'd let you know direct our experience in this restaurant. \r\n\r\nOverall centreparcs is great but this was not good. Our bill was a staggering £240 for a very poor quality experience.\r\n\r\nPlease send any responses to this email address (jontrapps@yahoo.com) not the original booking email address",

As we had opted for no meals on board a plane journey of 5.5 hours we decided to have a cooked breakfast prior to this journey. However, I was far from happy at the length of time it took for a cooked breakfast to arrive because it arrived within a minute of ordering it. It was lukewarm and had obviously all been ready cooked waiting for orders to go through. It was quite clear it had been sitting under a hot plate ready for orders to be made. It was not cooked from scratch and freshly made, which in view of £12 for a full breakfast should have been cooked fresh. We were very disappointed with the food. The plate was red hot and the food appeared to have a skin formation to it as if it had been under a hot plate for some time or had been cooked for some time before being plated up and served. The ketchup bottles on the table were both disgusting with sauce down the bottles and not at all hygienic. The fried eggs on every plate were broken. With a price tag of £12 per breakfast the least i expected was proper fried eggs with yolks that were not broken. The bacon was exceedingly fatty and salty. The sausages were synthetic tasting. The beans were mushy and with massive skin formation. There was no mushrooms on the plate when there should have been. The hash browns were very greasy. The toast we had ordered was lukewarm and not even freshly toasted. I opted for a coffee which was foul and thick as treacle The tea my mother ordered resembled dishwasher water and was lukewarm. . My husband opted for a diet coke, which I had emphasised with no ice and for it to be diet. The coke was full of ice. I found it quite appauling that you could not buy small drinks as he drank no more than 4 mouthfuls but needed a cold drink to take his tablets and feel you should offer the choice of even smaller drinks. However, what bothered me more than anything was that later that day he had a hyperglycaemic attack, which only ever happens when he drinks full fat coke, which is the reason I always emphasise diet coke. Luckily no extreme complications occurred and there were no serious consequences, but I would be grateful if you could emphasise to all staff the reasons why people chose diet sodas and that it is important that the drink orders are adhered to. I very much doubt I will be using any of your restaurants for food in an airport for fear of further disappointment and I would like to emphasise how disappointed I was with the food and the service. I look forward to your comments in due course. Many thanks Yours sincerely, G FAIRLESS",

I wasn't asked what garnish I wanted until Cheese was poured heavily on it. After saying I wanted no cheese, I was asked if I was allergic and said I was lactose intolerant. As they made my second burriot they almost put sour cream, but then didn't ask what salsa I wanted, and contiuned to push the guacomole throughout the process, as an add on I can pay extra for (I know this having visited hundreds of times). I went to pay (the price is too high, but that's not your fault) and asked what salsa \"hot\" level I was given and apparently it was mild, altho i was never asked. I asked to have medium hot and was dumped with a ton of \"hot sauce\" which has made my burrito inedible.

However, 25 minutes later, the toast had still not arrived.  I went to the bar and waited a further 5 minutes to catch someone’s eye to ask how long I was expected to wait, and was told that there was at least a 30 minute wait for food.\r\n\r\nThis is ludicrous for a slice of toast, and meant that by the time it arrived (55 minutes after originally joining the queue at the bar), the flight was being called and the toast could only be half eaten.\r\n\r\nI regularly fly from Bristol Airport and the Brunel bar seems to be the only outlet where there are constant queues at the bar due to inefficient staff, and continuous waits for food.  There was previously a policy that if certain food items were not delivered within 15 minutes, a refund would be given, which I took advantage of on many occasions.  This policy was withdrawn, presumably because too many refunds were being given, and replaced by a simple claim that food is aimed to be served within 15 minutes.  This is not the case on a morning (weekdays and weekends), as there is never enough staff on duty to cope with the level of customers.\r\n\r\nI have rarely experienced this type of service in other airport departure lounges, where staff and management seem to be aware that people in the departure lounge of an airport are on a time limit.

Without opening the baguette it looked empty from the outside and when I opened it was not much better.  It contained one slice of ham and 3 small slithers of mozzarella.  I would have not have paid £1 for this let alone the £3.99 I paid.  I will never use your store again, it is overpriced rubbish.",

Our experience is that you have a small sign in both the Estuary and the Kissing Gate telling customers to speak to staff if they have an allergy.

More and more people are being diagnosed as coeliac  (accounting for approx 1% of the population ie 1 in a 100 who can not eat in your restaurants) or eat gluten free diets due to wheat intolerance yet in a 'public place' like Liverpool Airport you are not taking responsibility for this or indeed recognising this could be an extra source of food sales. \r\nChanges were brought into legislation under Food Information Regulation regarding how caterers communicate information about food on 13 Dec 2014 and by putting a sign up but not addressing this in any other way you are failing in your duty to meet the nutritional needs of this group in a setting where there are no other options for them.

When we advised him that Delice de France was named on the voucher, he just said again that they weren't doing it anymore, at which point I showed him the sign they had on display asking us to tell you about our experience to receive such vouchers! The server then said that they would normally accept the vouchers but his manager hadn't told him we were coming. When we pointed out the ridiculousness of this, and after about 10 minutes of arguing in front of other customers which was extremely embarrassing, he eventually said he would allow us to have a sandwich, a drink and a packet of crisps but we couldn't have anything else to make it up to the £10.

But I have to say it was the most peppered tuna begette I have ever experienced in my life, totally uneatable. I mentioned it on the train to my friends and the girls near us also mentioned her disappointment in Upper Crest due to the removal of your chicken tikka sandwich. On this train carriage from Waterloo to Fleet we are all in agreement of our upset and disappointed of Cupper Crust. A suggestion has been made for pepper to be made available to those that want it and not forced upon people such as me!\r\nMany thanks, Katy",

          "value": "This is a followup. I've already spoken to Amit Beri who is the Terminal Manager for Pearson Airport in Toronto. I gave him the specifics of the situation and he wanted to speak to me. I informed him that I was visiting my cousin for a couple days and my phone didn't have roaming so if it was okay with my cousin I could use his phone for this. I also showed all the online complaints about this place. Maybe that was enough but the place was still there when I left, nothing had seemed like it had changed and now that finally I'm back home I figured I'd send this off.\r\n\r\nFirst off, you really don't make it easy to find you. I searched high and low on the internet to find this and it was only today when I sent a message to Amit did I bother looking up his email address which led me to foodtravelexperts.com and finally to here. If I were the suspicious type, which I am, I'd almost think that this was designed to prevent people from finding the parent company and allowing them to complain. But for the sake of being forthright, I'll let you know of my experience here. It's literally been almost three months and I'm still pissed about it.\r\n\r\n If there was a way to give zero stars I would. Back a couple months ago we were passing through Pearson and I was hungry so looking at the other options, which strangely were the same from restaurant to restaurant, we chose \"True Burger Co.\" because the lineup was long and that usually indicates it's popular.\r\n\r\nAfter spending ten minutes in line and it hardly moved we went and sat at the bar. A woman rudely asked if we were drinking anything because that was the only way we could sit there. I said sure, we ordered a couple of drinks, two cheeseburgers and an order of fries.\r\n\r\nThe food took some time and it looked like they were having trouble with their ordering system. More than once as we sat there waiting for our food somebody would come back saying they had forgotten something or didn't give them what they had ordered. A couple people just asked for their money back which was grudgingly given. This should have been our second clue that we shouldn't eat here but we had ordered and were drinking our overpriced airport beers so why change now?\r\n\r\nThe food arrives and it's just wrong. The burger looked okay. It had everything that we ordered on it but one bite and it all fell apart. The bun was cold and felt strange like it was made with something extra in it to make it fluffy. The meat was overly processed to the point of having no discernable texture. It was just soft and your teeth sank through it. It was also salty as hell. It literally tasted like it had been stored in a salt bath before throwing it in the microwave to heat up a bit. Yes, there was a lack of grilling on it. Or maybe it had kissed the flattop just enough to give it a slight browning before being nuked to hell.\r\n\r\nThe fries however were decent but it's really hard to mess up fries.\r\n\r\nI couldn't finish and neither could my girlfriend. It was absolutely disgusting and the worst part was the price. For the privilege of eating a nuked cheeseburger, decent fries and expensive bottle of beer it cost us almost $50.00. There was no tip because honestly the server didn't deserve one.\r\n\r\nI've worked service. I know about service and I get that sometimes you're busy but this woman wasn't. She spent most of her time standing around, getting snippy with the customers and not once did she ask us how the burger was. When it came time to pay she was busy talking with what I assumed was a friend as they were sitting at the bar with no drink or anything in front of them. So make of that what you will. It took her five minutes to realize we were waiting and then just gave us the bill without asking if we wanted anything else. My guess is she's been this way since the start and knows that once people taste the food, they don't want anything else.\r\n\r\nAnd the absolute worst part about this is I tried to find the company online. They have no online presence. I mean none other than through the airport which leads me to believe it's not a chain so much as it's something Pearson has developed in house. I contacted Pearson directly because I needed to complain and got the attention of the Terminal manager Amit Beri. His e-mail is Amit.Beri@foodtravelexperts.com. This is the only contact I've had. He contacted me once concerning this asking to speak with me, but since I'm not from Toronto and was travelling it was difficult to do. I showed him the online reviews of the place and said if my cousin whom I was staying with was willing to share his phone so we could talk I'd be willing to do that.\r\n\r\nHe never contacted me again. That was a little more than three weeks ago. I'm back home now and I'm pissed. Nobody should be able to get away with this kind of service in today's world. It's unacceptable and the fact that this person couldn't take the time to actually contact us for more information and to see what he could do to make things right is even worse. I didn't want a free meal because that would involve eating there again. I didn't want an apology. What I wanted was a guarantee that they would look into this and take matters in hand. So far, nothing.\r\n\r\nSo as a warning, avoid True Burger Co in Pearson airport Intl terminal. You'll thank me later.",

I told her that she should show her how to make a burrito properly her reply was \" God Bless You!!!  Really what does that have to do with it, it's a burrito simple training and follow up would fix this.  I could not believe how those burritos were being handed out to customers.  Do a surprise visit and see for yourself.  I travel fora living and am always heredi was surprised at your worker who did not even pretend to make an effort.

Can't give you names because no one wears a name tag and I can't read their airport badges, they're covered up. \r\n\r\nThere are at least 7 people back there working, and this is a very open 'kitchen' so I can see/hear everything they're doing..they're having a very engaging conversation about something totally mind numbing and inappropriate. I'm at an airport, which means I'm not on my lunch break, I'm trying to get somewhere and I don't have extra time to listen to them shoot the shit...please, just make my salad, the guy with the snot on his shirt is still grossing me out. \r\n\r\nFinally time to pay- it asks if I want to use visa debit or US Debit. I want to use credi, so I ask the  'cashier', who is participating in the stupid conversation and wasting my time, how to use credit. At this point I'm already pissed because of the above mentioned issues and I just want to go. She responds 'I have no idea' but not in a polite way or a sincere way, in a way that implies she just does not give a shit and I'm on my own to figure it out. She yells, yes, yells, for the manager, he's on the other side of the double doors so he doesn't hear her so she yells louder. The guy with the snot on his sleeve pushes a button on the card reader and gets it to work, not sure if he's still wearing those sterile gloves that keep my salad from getting his snotty fingers all over it. Id like to speak with the manager but when I realize he's part of the conversation crew I figure it's not worth my time, I'm outta here, and never coming back.",

I've had a number of lovely cookies from this store, all which have been very impressed with. I visited on the 4th July 2016 to purchase two giant cookies for Birthdays, and was really disappointed with how one of the cookies looked. We were very tempted to ask it to be redone but didn't have enough time to wait. The icing was very wonky, some letters were joined up and some were not, the writing was small and the under layer of the writing was very visible, as the top layer wasn't straight. Icing was very thin in places too; overall this cookie looked like it had been iced by a totally different person to the other cookie we had ordered at exactly the same time. I understand different people will ice different cookies, however I believe all staff icing should be sufficiently experienced to avoid cookies looking like ours did. I don't normally complain, but I've been coming to this store for years now and know that the quality of the cookies are normally so much better than the one we've received. This visit has made me reluctant to come to this branch of Millie's Cookies again in the future; I have attached a collage of some of the cookies I've previously ordered, and the cookie I am complaining about is the one on the bottom right hand hand, reading 'Happy 15th Birthday Lucy xx'. I hope you understand my disappointment, and would appreciate your feedback. \r\n\r\nKind regards, Lauren.",

On getting another round of drinks at 13.37pm (£29.25) I enquired how much longer our food would be to be told all food in the kitchen had been dealt with! The bar staff then called their manager who said there had been a power cut in the kitchen hence reason no food - surely the bar staff who took out order should have been aware of this? He said that the power cut had happened 20 minutes ago and that someone was going around telling people. We never had a visit from anyone and were sitting on the tables right next to the bar. A gentleman who ordered after me came to the bar and said he had had his food in front of the manager so when I asked him why this was I was told it was because his order was smaller than mine - surely each order no matter what size should be done in whose order was placed first. Our group felt that his attitude was not good especially when we had two young children (2 and 4) who by this time were extremely hungry. All he said was that we could order again and wait another 30minutes for it to come out - does he not understand people in an airport have a plane to catch and cannot keep waiting for food to arrive? He did refund our money for the food to which we went to another food area in the airport and got our food very quickly. Very poor service indeed.",

The shift manager Jack was an excellent host and sorted us a table which we chose and brought over birthday balloons and seemed to actually care.I had the rib eye steak which was cooked excellently and the whole experience was great. Very pleased.\r\n\r\nWe were looking forward to our second visit but honestly wish we hadn't bothered.\r\n\r\nWe were asked on arrival - 'have you booked!?' before even a hello or welcome greeting was exchanged, which suggested to me a busy night ahead. This was not the case as the restaurant was half empty throughout our meal.\r\n\r\nWe waited for 50 minutes for three meals in an empty restaurant and when they arrived they were very disappointing. I had the cheeseburger with chips and a side of onion rings. The chips were soggy and under cooked and the onion rings can only be described as anaemic - undercooked would imply they had actually seen the frier! They were white in colour and soggy to the touch, almost raw. i had to send them back...after waiting almost an hour for them i was not best pleased.\r\nCouldn't even get the menu right...I ordered a Budweiser off the menu only to be told \"we don't do Bud\" Despite it being on the menu! And went highlighted to my waiter the response was \"sorry we need to change the menu.\" Not a huge issue...but considering the high standards of the rest of the village and paying around £20 per head, I would expect these simply things to be right.\r\n\r\n3 stars as the saving grace was the first visit which was in fairness very good.

I ordered this item as a gift for my partner who works away in the Navy and as I have a busy lifestyle myself I thought ordering this online was the best option. The state the product arrived in when it reached me on 1/7/16 was appalling and I have attached a picture for you to see with wrapping intact so it could not be suggested it was tampered with in any way. The cookie itself was in pieces and the writing I had arranged to be done was incomprehensible and squashed. Due to the horrific state of the product I was unable to give his to my partner. Although I appreciate the the cookie is of a delicate nature that can easily broken, for a £4.99 charge for postage and packaging I would expect a lot more care and attention into the safe delivery of my item, I think you will agree by the picture that the condition the parcel arrived in was completely unacceptable. The item was not labelled as such to identify the fragile and breakable nature and the box was obviously not sufficient to keep it all intact. I feel there was a severe lack of communication and little regard for my parcel and I do not feel it would be unreasonable to suggest I receive some sort of compensation for the inconvenience.

Cashier reset and same thing happened again. She then took my credit card and completed transaction.  All with minimal communication or acknowledgement of my trouble.

When I was finally able to get her attention and ask her what my number was she said I should know it. I said I didn't know it so she asked me for my receipt. She said your #89 and walked away. When I was able to catch her attention again I asked her if the was order #89 she called previously and put back on the shelf unclaimed. She said no and went on delivering other orders. After calling a few more orders she went back, grabbed the 2 bags I questioned as being #89 and brought them to me. We exchanged some words and I walked to my gate to bring the food to my family. On top of the poor service, my cheeseburger had no cheese was no longer hot. Nor were the fries hot. My daughter ate one bite of her burger and refused to any more.

When it was given back to me it was still very cold so I asked for it to be toasted again, this was met with grunts and not any apology, just threw it back in the machine.
